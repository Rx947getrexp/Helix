# VecLite - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

VecLite is a lightweight, embeddable vector search library designed for independent developers and small teams who need efficient vector similarity search without the complexity of enterprise-grade vector databases. Inspired by SQLite's philosophy of being embedded and zero-configuration, VecLite provides complete vector search functionality in a single, dependency-free library.
