# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of Helix with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Helix seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Report Security Vulnerabilities Publicly

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or any other public channels.

### 2. Private Reporting

Send vulnerability reports to: **security@helix.io**

Include the following information in your report:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

### 3. Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of receipt
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours of receipt
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days for critical issues, 30 days for others
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

### 4. Scope

This security policy applies to the following:

**In Scope:**
- The main Helix library (`src/` directory)
- CLI tools and binaries
- Docker images and containers
- Build and deployment scripts
- Dependencies with direct security impact

**Out of Scope:**
- Documentation websites
- Example applications
- Third-party integrations not maintained by us
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Helix in production:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Review and harden your configuration
3. **Network Security**: Use proper firewall rules and network isolation
4. **Access Control**: Implement authentication and authorization
5. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
6. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting
7. **Backups**: Maintain secure, regular backups

### For Developers

When contributing to Helix:

1. **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
2. **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to detect issues
3. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and secure
4. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets or credentials
5. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
6. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in errors
7. **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite

## Security Features

Helix includes several security features:

### Memory Safety
- Written in Rust for memory safety by default
- Protection against buffer overflows and memory corruption
- Safe concurrent access with ownership system

### Input Validation
- Strict validation of vector dimensions and metadata
- Protection against malformed data
- Bounds checking on all operations

### Configuration Security
- Secure defaults for all configuration options
- Validation of configuration parameters
- Clear documentation of security implications

### Container Security
- Non-root user in Docker containers
- Minimal attack surface in container images
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. **Report Received**: We acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Release Preparation**: We prepare a security release
5. **Public Disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is available

### Timeline

- **0 days**: Vulnerability reported privately
- **1-3 days**: Initial assessment and acknowledgment
- **7-30 days**: Fix development and testing
- **Release day**: Security update released
- **Release day + 7**: Public disclosure of vulnerability details

### Recognition

We maintain a security hall of fame to recognize researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

**Security Researchers:**
- [Your name could be here]

### Bounty Program

We are considering implementing a bug bounty program. Details will be announced if/when this program is established.

## Security Architecture

### Trust Boundaries

Helix's security model considers the following trust boundaries:

1. **Application Boundary**: Between Helix and calling applications
2. **Network Boundary**: Between Helix instances and clients
3. **Storage Boundary**: Between Helix and persistent storage
4. **Process Boundary**: Between Helix and the operating system

### Threat Model

We consider the following threats:

**High Priority:**
- Remote code execution through malicious vectors or metadata
- Information disclosure through timing attacks or error messages
- Denial of service through resource exhaustion
- Data corruption through malicious inputs

**Medium Priority:**
- Memory exhaustion attacks
- Algorithmic complexity attacks
- Configuration injection attacks

**Lower Priority:**
- Physical access attacks
- Social engineering attacks
- Supply chain attacks (mitigated through dependency scanning)

## Security Tools

We use the following tools to maintain security:

- **Cargo Audit**: Scanning for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Cargo Deny**: License and dependency policy enforcement
- **Clippy**: Static analysis for Rust code
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis
- **Semgrep**: Pattern-based static analysis
- **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
