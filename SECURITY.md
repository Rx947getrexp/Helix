# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions of Helix:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your help in keeping Helix secure.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing us at:
- **Email**: security@helix-project.org (if available)
- **Alternative**: Create a private security advisory on GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
4. **Environment**: Version, platform, and configuration details
5. **Proof of Concept**: If available, include PoC code (but not exploits)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Status Update**: Every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution**: Target 30-90 days depending on complexity

### Security Process

1. **Triage**: We evaluate the severity and impact
2. **Investigation**: Our team investigates and develops fixes
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of patches
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fixes are available
5. **Release**: Security patches are released promptly

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
- **Validate Inputs**: Sanitize all vector data and metadata
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
- **Network Security**: Use TLS/SSL for network communications
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate memory and CPU limits
- **Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring for security events

### For Developers

- **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused code review
- **Static Analysis**: Use SAST tools (Semgrep, CodeQL) in CI/CD
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets or API keys
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Avoid information leakage in error messages

## Known Security Considerations

### Rust Unsafe Code

Helix uses `unsafe` code for:
- SIMD optimizations (AVX2, SSE2)
- FFI bindings for Go integration
- Memory-mapped I/O operations

All unsafe code includes:
- Safety documentation
- Bounds checking where applicable
- Extensive testing

### Go FFI Bindings

The Go bindings use CGO which involves:
- Unsafe pointer operations
- Memory management across language boundaries
- C string conversions

Security measures:
- Input validation before FFI calls
- Memory safety checks
- Error handling for all FFI operations

### Data Privacy

- **Vector Data**: Vectors may contain sensitive information
- **Metadata**: Arbitrary key-value pairs may include PII
- **Persistence**: Data is stored unencrypted by default
- **Memory**: Sensitive data may remain in memory

Recommendations:
- Encrypt sensitive data before storing
- Use secure deletion for temporary files
- Implement data retention policies
- Consider memory scrubbing for sensitive vectors

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **Input Validation**: Dimension checking, type validation
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable memory and vector limits
- **Error Handling**: Safe error propagation without information leakage
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's memory safety with careful unsafe usage

### Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:
- **SAST**: Semgrep, CodeQL static analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: cargo-audit for vulnerabilities
- **Container Security**: Trivy, Snyk for container images
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog, GitLeaks for secrets
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking
- **Fuzz Testing**: Regular fuzzing of core functions

## Threat Model

### In Scope

- Code injection through vector data or metadata
- Memory corruption vulnerabilities
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Container security issues
- Data exfiltration through timing attacks
- Resource exhaustion attacks

### Out of Scope

- Physical access to systems
- Social engineering attacks
- Network infrastructure vulnerabilities
- Operating system vulnerabilities
- Hardware-level attacks (Spectre, Meltdown)
